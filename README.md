### Hello! 👋

**I'm Michelle Jiam, a software engineering student at [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/en/), a [42 Network](https://www.codam.nl/en/the-42-network) school located in Amsterdam.**

I enjoy solving puzzles 🧩 of all shapes and sizes.

Here on my GitHub you'll find both school and personal projects, including testers and coding competition submissions.

My interests include cybersecurity 👩‍💻, user-centered design/development 🖥️, and where to get the best pastries in town 🥐.
